# C# Snippets

- **Notes:**
  -  **October 14th, 2021:** ~Most, if not all, of these snippets target .NET 5. That isn't to say they *won't* work with older (or different) versions of .NET but I am only testing them on .NET 5. I plan to keep them updated once .NET 6 arrives later this year.~
  -  **May 25th, 2023:** Snippets have been updated and, unless otherwise specified, now all target .NET 6. 

**Description:** A useful collection of C# snippets that I've either written or otherwise accumulated throughout the years.
