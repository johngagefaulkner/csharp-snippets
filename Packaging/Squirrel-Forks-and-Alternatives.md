# Squirrel Forks and Alternatives
Over the years, there have been many, *many*, projects created as a derivative of Squirrel. Here's some of the best (and maybe even some of the worst!)

### Clowd.Squirrel
> **Repository:** [clowd/Clowd.Squirrel](https://github.com/clowd/Clowd.Squirrel)

This project is a direct fork of Squirrel with the intentions of *only* improving the shortcomings of Squirrel, *not* entirely replacing the existing codebase.
Here's an excerpt from the repo's readme itself:

> This project is a fork of the library Squirrel.Windows. The main focus here has been to update to more modern tooling, such as upgrading the main libraries to netstandard2.0, upgrading the tools to net6.0, and adding lots of fixes for dotnet core support.

> This library will help you build a Setup.exe, integrated (or standalone Update.exe) application updater, and release updates to your users very quickly and easily. The Setup.exe and Update.exe produced by this library are completely dependency free, and can even help you bootstrap/install any number of runtimes your app needs (such as dotnet 5/6, .net 4.8 or others).
