# Dictionaries
Each of these classes contain dictionaries usually used to condense boilerplate, reduce complexity for some specific action or to simply make my code look cleaner in other areas.

## Examples
 - **Punctuations:** Provides methods to easily select a Punctuation Mark from an `enum` and choose whether you'd like it to return as a `char` or a `string`. Use-cases? None, really. I just don't like writing `"\""` each time I need a Quotation Mark as that can *quickly* become confusing and/or difficult to work with.
