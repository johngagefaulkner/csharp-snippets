# Overview

While the other files and folders in this repo are simply snippets of code that can be used throughout your existing application, the files and folders contained in this repo are sample projects that are fully-standalone. These sample apps can be downloaded, compiled and ran without any additional input required from you.

# Samples

- [**CustomTitleBar**](/Samples/CustomTitleBar/readme.md)
    - **Summary:** Displays how to create, and properly implement, a custom UserControl that will be used as a replacement for the default Application TitleBar. This specific example was built with the intention of sharing an all-inclusive sample app that shows *everything* required to have a fully-custom titlebar. This includes displaying the App Icon and App Title along with multiple interactive (interactable?) controls in both the center and right-side of the titlebar while retaining draggable regions in the rest of the space available.
