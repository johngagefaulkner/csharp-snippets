# C# Snippets â€¢ UWP
Because I haven't written many snippets for UWP apps, most of the entries will be references to other people's work. Please note that I have done my best effort to find the original creator of each entry. If I was wrong or that data is missing, please feel free to message me on GitHub and I will correct it.
